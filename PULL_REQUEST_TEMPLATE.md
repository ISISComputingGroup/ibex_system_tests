#### Code Review

- [ ] Is the code of an acceptable quality?
- [ ] Does the code make use of existing procedures where appropriate?
- [ ] Do they test a minimal set of functionality and leave the gui as close as possible to its original state?
- [ ] Does the name of the tests reflect what is actually being tested?
- [ ] Has the [manual system tests spreadsheet](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Manual-system-tests) been updated to have entries equivalent to the system tests affected?
    - For example, remove manual tests that are covered by automated tests

### Functional Tests

- [ ] Do the new tests pass on a GUI build containing the fix?
- [ ] Do the new tests fail on a GUI build NOT containing the fix (e.g. master)?
